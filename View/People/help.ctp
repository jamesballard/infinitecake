<h1>People<i class="icon-question-sign"></i></h1>
<p>A person is anyone using one of your systems and is the lens (subject) through which all activity is analysed. A person may
    have multiple <?php echo $this->Html->link('user', array('controller' => 'Users', 'action' => 'help')); ?> accounts across
    different systems and can belong to one or more
    <?php echo $this->Html->link('courses', array('controller' => 'Courses', 'action' => 'help')); ?>.</p>
<p>People are automagically created on import, or can be uploaded via a CSV. The auto-import will only use the idnumber field
to maintain privacy, however it is possible for this to be supplemented with demographic and other information to enrich your
analysis.</p>
