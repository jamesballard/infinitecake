<h1>Groups<i class="icon-question-sign"></i></h1>
<p>Groups are system contexts in which activites take place. These vary considerably per system but allow the possibility of
    seeing where multiple users may be visiting the same space but without necessarily interacting directly. This may come to
    represent a type of indirect communication or abstractly shared knowledge. Groups can be configured to belong to
    <?php echo $this->Html->link('courses', array('controller' => 'Courses', 'action' => 'help')); ?> to help understand this
    type of activity in an institutional context across systems.</p>
